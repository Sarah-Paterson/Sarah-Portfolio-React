# Sarah Paterson Portfolio

## What this portfolio is all about

This website, with reactjs, is designed to provide a single landing page providing future employers information about me, examples of my work, a way to contact me, and a resume ready to be downloaded.

My motivation was to have all my professional qualities and contact information in a single, visually appealing, and easy to use space. So, I built this project to centralize that information and give future employers ease of access to my information.
